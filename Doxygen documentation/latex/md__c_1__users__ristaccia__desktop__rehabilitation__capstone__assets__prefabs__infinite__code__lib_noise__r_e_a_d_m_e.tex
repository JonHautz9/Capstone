\subsection*{About}

\href{http://libnoise.sourceforge.net/}{\tt Lib\+Noise} was originally created by Jason Bevins. The library was later ported to Xna by \href{http://www.big-black-block.com/#home}{\tt Marc André Ueberall}, and moved to Unity by Tim Speltz. Speltz’s original development forum thread contains a Unity package with an example scene, which can be found \href{http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/68764-LibNoise-Ported-to-Unity}{\tt here}. Please note that Lib\+Noise.\+Unity is only a repository for the library code itself and contains no example files.

\href{https://github.com/ricardojmendez/LibNoiseTutorials}{\tt You can also see the converted tutorials examples on this repository}.

Other contributors to Lib\+Noise.\+Unity include \href{https://github.com/teddybradford}{\tt Teddy Bradford} who reworked much of the Noise2D class to improve tiling support for noise maps.
