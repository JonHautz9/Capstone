This project was developed by my Capstone group for our Capstone class, CSCI 4970, at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. It was presented at the PKI Student Capstone & Research Conference on April 28, 2017. This was a collaboration with the University of Nebraska Medical Center to create a virtual environment using the Unity3D game engine and interfaced with Delsys Trigno devices.

# Abstract

In physical therapy, motion control systems are often been utilized to simulate patient movement in virtual environments. These systems benefit both the patient by providing a controlled environment for therapy and physical therapists by giving immediate and detailed feedback on patient performance. With increasing reliance on these systems there is a need for more affordable systems with robust virtual environments. This project seeks to provide a solution to this problem by using an array of sensors that cost roughly 10% of a motion capture system while also providing data on muscle activation. All this while still providing the users (physical therapists and patients) with the same functions they would use in a motion capture system. Using Delsys Trignos as an interface, this project was able to produce a virtual environment that provides useful feedback to both patients and physical therapists.
