# Introduction 

This project was developed by my Capstone group for our Capstone class, CSCI 4970, at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.

This project was presented at the PKI Student Capstone & Research Conference on April 28, 2017. It was a collaboration with the University of Nebraska Medical Center to create a virtual environment using the Unity3D game engine and interfaced with Delsys Trigno devices.
