# Introduction #

This project was the result of my Capstone class at UNO.

This project was presented at the PKI Student Capstone & Research Conference on April 28, 2017. It was a collaboration with the University of Nebraska Medical Center to create a virtual environment using the Unity3D game engine and interfaced with Delsys Trigno devices.
